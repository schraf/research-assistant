      description: |
        Submits a research request for the specified topic. The request is queued for 
        asynchronous processing. The research process includes:
        
        1. Planning: Generates a research plan with subtopics and questions
        2. Knowledge Gathering: Iteratively gathers knowledge on each subtopic
        3. Analysis: Analyzes collected knowledge to identify gaps
        4. Synthesis: Synthesizes all research into a structured report
        5. Publishing: Posts the report to Telegraph
        6. Notification: Sends an email with the report URL
        
        The API returns immediately with a request ID. The actual research is performed 
        asynchronously by a backend worker.
